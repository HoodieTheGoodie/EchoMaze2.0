INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING CUSTOM SPRITES
========================================

To add your custom textures to the game:

1. Save your three images as:
   - bazooka.png (for the bazooka pickup)
   - generator.png (for the generator tiles)  
   - ammo_crate.png (for the ammo crates)

2. Place them in this folder: /workspaces/EchoMaze2.0/game/assets/

3. The images should be PNG format with transparent backgrounds

4. Recommended sizes:
   - bazooka.png: 20x20 pixels (or larger, will be scaled)
   - generator.png: 20x20 pixels (matches tile size)
   - ammo_crate.png: 16x16 pixels (or larger, will be scaled)

5. The game will automatically load and use them!

If the images fail to load, the game will fall back to the original 
geometric shapes (circles and squares).

Current Status:
- ✓ Sprite loading system created
- ✓ Renderer updated to use sprites
- ✓ Fallback rendering preserved
- ⏳ Waiting for image files to be added

Simply drag and drop your images into this assets folder!
