WARNING: This is still a work in progress game so there may be many bugs and glitchs If you find any feel free to let Either Developer know and we will work on fixing them

Main Thought Process behind this game: This game was a project I started being bored out of my mind during class in school and because most games are blocked I thought I might as well make my own and because this was my first time coding a game I wanted to try to make it simple and easy to add new ideas as they came to me.

Main Idea of the game: Im not going to explain much of how the game works as thats for you to figure out when playing that game. The main objective of the game is to escape the level as fast as possible as you are timed on doing so, Your main abilitys at the Moment is your shield ability (Space Bar) and your Dash Ability (Hold Shift) 

For Speedrun times there is a global leader board that if you show me proof of your best runs I will add the best times to the global leader board for everyone to see (Best runs by the end of the year will get a special prize, ONLY IF ENOUGH PEOPLE PARTICIPATE) And obviously cheating will get you banned of the leader board and if assumed of cheating in some way ur time will not be accepts.
